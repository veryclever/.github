We're working on something. It's important. That's all you need to know for now.

The initiative, internally referred to as **Project Nightingale**, represents a strategic advancement in our operational capabilities. While we cannot disclose specific details at this time due to the sensitive nature of the work, we can confirm that select team members are actively engaged in development efforts that align with our long-term vision.

Further information will be made available on a need-to-know basis.
